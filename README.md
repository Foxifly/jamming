## Introduction

The Codecademy final project required students to create a React Application from scratch. This application uses the Spotify API to authenticate a user through Spotify in order to create playlists and publish tracks. 

This application allows a user to search tracks based on a query in the input field, and add them to a playlist which then POSTs to Spotify. 

In addition to this project, a Feature Request Technical Document was created to reflect a possible To Do for this project. This Feature Request can be found [Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11WD2Jt_g9Y_zLC4ZADHO6P300EdPNZoE3FtcsCfVRDg/edit?usp=sharing) and will be inplemented into Jammming Soon. 

## How To Use

Download the repository from [here](https://github.com/Foxifly/jamming)

Navigate to the jamming subfolder and run `npm start`

This will start the app on `localhost:3000/`

Once it is running, search for a track on the top search bar. Once you press search, the application will ask you to authenticate. 

After you have authenticated with Spotify, search again for the track name you're looking for. 

Keep looking for tracks and pressing the "+" to add it to a playlist. Once you're satisified with the playlist content, give it a name and press "Save to Spotify". 

After saving, check the Spotify App for your new playlist!
